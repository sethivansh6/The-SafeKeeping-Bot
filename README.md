# The-SafeKeeping-Bot
## Inspiration
Toxicity online poses a serious challenge for platforms and publishers. Online abuse and harassment silence important voices in conversation, forcing already marginalized people offline. Thus to build a safer and more healthy environment, we decided to build SafeKeeping bot.

## What it does
1. For normal users of the server -  
The discord bot is capable of detecting the following type of messages -
Toxicity  
Identity Attack  
Insult  
Profanity  
Threat  
It also keeps a log of the number of warnings a user has got.  
2. Moderator Perms -  
Moderators of the server have the following permissions -  
To Get the number of warnings a user has got.  
To Remove the warnings for a user.  
The bot deletes the inappropriate messages.  
The bot being a moderator itself, kicks the user from the server when the warnings received by them are more than 5.   
With this discord bot, moderators can ensure that no message sent hampers the peaceful environment of the server.

## How we built it
We have made use of the following technologies -  
**Python -** The entire code is in python.  
**Perspective API -** For analyzing the messages for inappropriate behaviour.  
**Discord API -** For creating the discord bot.  
**Google Cloud Platform -** Perspective API is enabled using GCP.  

## Challenges we ran into
The ideation in itself was a challenge. We wanted to build something that could help the community and curb the online harassment, toxicity and bullying. We also faced challenges while trying to fetch and analyze each message and to maintain the warnings log.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The implementation of the entire project helped us realize the importance of collaboration and the dynamics of working in a team In every Hackathon, proper time management plays a crucial role that can become a determining factor for the overall progress; we understood the instrumentality of following the code of conduct and treating fellow developers with respect while learning and improving through their feedback. We are proud of completing the project in time.

## What we learned
We learnt a lot about the Discord API and also about the Perspective API. We also learnt about using the Google Cloud Platform and how APIs work in GCP.

## What's next for The SafeKeeping Bot
We wish to add more features like complimenting users, sending positive messages, better logging, etc.
